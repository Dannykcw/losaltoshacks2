Introduction
This is the repo for the project me and my friends created at the Annual Los Altos hacks. 
This is also my first "real project", basing on the fact that no template code is provided and we wrote it from scratch. Compere to the table next to us (who won the solo award), our website is quite... barebone. That beening said, we learn a lot from our first hackathon, including how terrible I am at programing

Technologies
Builded using Bootstrap, HTML, and JS.

Fun fact
Fun fact: We forgot to inculde the required js file from the Bootstrap liabary in the html, so the navbar drop down doesn't work.
Fun fact two: We went using the VS Code GUI for commits, but we it was stuck in the comit cycle. Turns out we didn't know you have to connect and push to a remote repo!
I learn the Git CLi much later.

With all the out of the way, visit the wesite and start saving the planet!
